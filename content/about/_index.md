### White Rock Bookbinding & Restoration
![](/spacer.png)


**White Rock Bookbinding and Restoration** specialize in high quality hand restoration and conservation bookbinding. British born Lawrence Traynor has been a professional in the field since 1956. We have a small workshop near the White Rock Beach.

White Rock Bookbinding and Restoration Company are committed to the standards of the **traditional art of bookbinding practice**. We are able to offer a wide range of services including restoration of books as well as preservation and presentation of valuable papers, important documents and rare maps. We also specialize in fine and custom designed bindings.

Our commitment to the traditional methods and standards of the art of bookbinding along with **meticulous craftsmanship** has secured our work a respectful reputation among astute collectors, booksellers and institutions across Canada.


Only the **finest materials** and **techniques** are used to ensure that repairs are long lasting, reversible (so the book can be repaired again in the future), and non-damaging (many quick repair techniques actually damage the books they are meant to help).


As much as the original book is retained and preserved as possible. Each book I receive is handled and treated with the utmost care during the process.  


**Based near to Vancouver BC, we are happy to provide our book restoration services to customers in the Greater Vancouver area and the rest of North America.**
